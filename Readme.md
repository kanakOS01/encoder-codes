# Encoder Code file for Debug Decrypt Round 2 (2024)

You are given encoder codes that give certain output for certain inputs. Let the input be **I** and the output be **O**. 

You need to develop a decoder code such that when we give **O** as the input to this decoder code we get **I** as the output.

The codes are given in 3 languages i.e. `java`, `python` and `c++`.
